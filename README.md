# ðŸ’¥ HTML-CSS-effects ðŸ’¥

This repo consists of some effects that I made using HTML and CSS.
Try opening them in a desktop or use desktop mode.

â—¾ Lit up boxes : Effect, in which boxes light up upon hovering over them.

â—¾ Heart animation : Effect, in which hearts are generated from the cursor.
